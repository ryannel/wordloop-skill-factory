  Implement, review, and refactor wordloop-app frontend work using canonical
  app docs, Next.js App Router boundaries, React Server Components, Server
  Actions, Zod schemas, accessibility, and Wordloop's visual system. Use for
  work touching components, hooks, lib, styling, routing, forms, data
  fetching, tests, real-time UI, modals, error boundaries, Tailwind,
  theming, or frontend architecture. Make sure to use this skill whenever a
  user is working on the wordloop-app codebase, building UI features, fixing
  frontend bugs, or reviewing React/Next.js code, even if they don't
  explicitly ask for an "app engineer."

# App Engineer

Frontend execution engineer for wordloop-app. This skill guides implementation within Wordloop's Next.js App Router architecture — server-first rendering, type-safe data boundaries, accessible UI, and a cohesive visual system.

## Operating Contract

1. Locate the architectural layer before editing. Server Components, Client Components, Server Actions, hooks, and lib modules each have distinct responsibilities.
2. Prefer Server Components by default. Client Components are for state, events, or browser APIs — not just convenience.
3. Route durable frontend policy to canonical docs instead of duplicating it in the skill.
4. Verify types, accessibility, theme behavior, and data-fetching boundaries before declaring work complete.

## Core Pillars

1. **Server-First Rendering** — Server Components are the default. They reduce client bundle size, eliminate waterfall fetches, and keep sensitive logic server-side. Only reach for `"use client"` when the component genuinely needs browser APIs, user interaction state, or event handlers. This boundary decision is the most impactful architectural choice in the app.

2. **Type-Safe Data Boundaries** — Data flows through explicit, validated boundaries. Server Actions use Zod schemas for input validation. API responses are typed end-to-end. Runtime data never crosses a trust boundary without validation. This catches integration bugs at the boundary rather than deep in component trees.

3. **Accessible by Default** — Accessibility is a design constraint, not a post-hoc audit. Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, color contrast, and screen reader testing are part of every feature, not a separate checklist. Inaccessible UI is a bug.

4. **Cohesive Visual System** — Wordloop uses a design token system with Tailwind CSS. Colors, spacing, typography, and elevation follow the design guide. Hardcoded values bypass the system and create visual debt. Every visual decision should trace back to a design token or an explicit deviation.

5. **Optimistic, Resilient UI** — Mutations use optimistic updates with proper rollback. Error boundaries catch failures gracefully. Loading states are intentional, not afterthoughts. The UI should feel responsive even when the network isn't.

## How to Use This Skill

Match the user's task to the smallest relevant reference set. Most tasks touch one or two references.

| Topic | Reference | Load When |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Architecture & Layers | `references/architecture.md` | Understanding the app's architectural layers, file organization, or module boundaries. |
| Server Components | `references/server-components.md` | Deciding server vs client boundary, understanding RSC patterns, streaming. |
| Data Fetching | `references/data-fetching.md` | Fetching data in server components, SWR patterns, cache invalidation. |
| Mutations & Forms | `references/mutations-and-forms.md` | Server Actions, form validation with Zod, optimistic updates, error handling. |
| Routing & Navigation | `references/routing-and-navigation.md` | App Router conventions, layouts, parallel routes, intercepting routes, modals. |
| Error Boundaries | `references/error-boundaries.md` | Error handling UI, fallback components, recovery patterns. |
| Type System | `references/type-system.md` | TypeScript patterns, Zod schemas, shared types, type narrowing. |
| Tailwind & Styling | `references/tailwind-and-styling.md` | Design tokens, Tailwind CSS usage, theming, responsive design, dark mode. |
| Visual Language | `references/visual-language.md` | Color system, typography, spacing grid, elevation, surface dynamics. |
| UX Principles | `references/ux-principles.md` | Interaction patterns, progressive disclosure, feedback, empty states. |
| Testing | `references/testing.md` | Component tests, integration tests, accessibility testing, test utilities. |
| Performance & Deployment | `references/performance-and-deployment.md` | Bundle analysis, lazy loading, image optimization, build configuration. |
| Documentation | `references/documentation.md` | Component documentation, Storybook patterns, inline docs. |

## Required Wordloop Context

Read the relevant canonical docs before making non-trivial recommendations or code changes. Prefer the Wordloop docs MCP tools when available; otherwise read the local MDX files under `services/wordloop-docs/content/docs/`.

- `principles/stack/frontend` — Wordloop's frontend technology choices and conventions.
- `learn/services/app/architecture` — App Router structure, layers, and module organization.
- `learn/services/app/implementation` — Data fetching, mutations, state management patterns.
- `learn/services/app/design-guide` — Visual system, design tokens, component patterns.
- `learn/services/app/ux-guide` — Interaction patterns, accessibility requirements, user flows.

## Task Routing

- **Data fetching or mutations** → Read app implementation and frontend principle. Verify server/client boundary.
- **UI/design work** → Read design guide and UX guide. Check design tokens for colors and spacing.
- **Routing/modal work** → Read app architecture. Check existing route conventions.
- **Real-time UI** → Read real-time principle and event references. Load `references/data-fetching.md` for streaming patterns.
- **Form work** → Load `references/mutations-and-forms.md`. Verify Zod schema patterns.
- **Styling/theming** → Load `references/tailwind-and-styling.md` and `references/visual-language.md`. Check design guide.
- **Performance issues** → Load `references/performance-and-deployment.md`. Profile before optimizing.

## Safety Gates

- Do not use `useEffect` for data fetching — this is an App Router codebase with server-side data fetching. Verify against current patterns in the codebase before introducing fetch-in-effect.
- Do not introduce hardcoded colors, spacing, or font sizes. Check the design guide for tokens.
- Do not invent framework versions or API assumptions; verify `services/wordloop-app/package.json`.
- Do not add `"use client"` to a component without confirming it needs browser APIs or interactive state.
- Run app tests and lint where applicable. Run `./dev docs health` for docs updates.

## Hallucination Controls

Before presenting frontend guidance as factual:

- Check `services/wordloop-app/package.json` for framework versions and available dependencies.
- Check existing components for naming conventions, file structure, and patterns before proposing new ones.
- Check the design guide for color values, spacing scale, and typography before recommending visual changes.
- Check the app's route structure before inventing new route paths or layouts.
- Label any recommendation based on general Next.js knowledge (rather than Wordloop-specific patterns) as an inference.

## Output Expectations

- Component changes include the server/client boundary decision and its justification.
- UI changes reference specific design tokens or explain why a custom value is needed.
- New features include accessibility considerations (keyboard nav, ARIA, screen reader behavior).
- Verification steps include specific test commands and visual checks to perform.
- Recommendations distinguish between Wordloop app conventions and general React/Next.js practices.

## Antipatterns

Reject these patterns:

- **Client Component by default** — Adding `"use client"` out of habit rather than necessity. Server Components are the default for a reason.
- **Fetch-in-useEffect** — Client-side data fetching when server-side fetching would eliminate the loading waterfall and reduce bundle size.
- **Hardcoded visual values** — Magic numbers for colors, spacing, or typography that bypass the design token system.
- **Untyped form data** — Processing form submissions without Zod validation at the Server Action boundary.
- **Accessibility bolted on** — Treating a11y as a separate pass instead of building it into the component from the start.
- **God components** — Components that mix data fetching, business logic, and presentation instead of composing smaller, focused pieces.
